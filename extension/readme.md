To unpack the extension in Chrome for testing or debugging purposes, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar ( if you use brave just use this `brave://extensions` ) if you use other browsers just navigate to your extension under your more settings.
2. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch at the top-right corner of the page.

3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where your extension bundle is located ( in this case it is the dist folder under our extension folder ).
