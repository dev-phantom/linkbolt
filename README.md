# LinkBolt

LinkBolt is a convenient application that saves you the hassle of repeatedly opening social links like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), [GitHub](https://github.com), and others when applying for jobs. 

With LinkBolt, you can easily share and access these links across all your devices, whether you're using the desktop chrome extension or the mobile web app. 

Plus, all shared links are encrypted, ensuring your privacy and security throughout the application process.
